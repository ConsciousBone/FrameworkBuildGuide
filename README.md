# FrameworkBuildGuide (WIP)
FrameworkBuildGuide is an iOS/iPadOS app that is, as the name may suggest, a build/repair guide for the Framework line of computers; built for Hack Club's Siege Week 12!  
It supports both iOS and iPadOS, as well as Mac and Apple Vision Pro using *Designed for iPad*!  
This is a work in progress, and many sections just have links to the actual FW build guides. Generally, if a guide has "Open original guide" under it, it's in the app. Here's a list of what is ported over:  
- Laptop 12
    - New build
    - Audio board
    - Battery
    - Display cover
    - Input cover
    - Memory
    - Stylus battery
    - Stylus tips
